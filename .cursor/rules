# Cursor Rules for Scripts

## Commit Message Format

When creating commit messages, always add "AI-generated: <percentage>" as the last line of the commit message, with an empty line before it. Do NOT add AI-generated to the first line of the commit message.

Example commit messages:
```
feat: Add new script

AI-generated: 80%
```

```
fix: Resolve script issue

AI-generated: 30%
```

```
docs: Update documentation

AI-generated: 100%
```

The percentage should reflect the approximate amount of code/content that was generated or significantly modified by AI assistance.
